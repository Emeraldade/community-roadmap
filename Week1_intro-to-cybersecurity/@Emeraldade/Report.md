Cyber Attack
In August 2024, the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) fined Fidelity Bank ₦ 555.8
million for breaching data privacy laws.The investigation began from a complaint in April 2023,
which alleged that Fidelity Bank processed a customer ’ s personal data without their informed
consent during the account-opening process
The breach involved using online account-opening tools (including banking apps and cookies)
in ways that violated the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR, 2019) and the Nigeria Data
Protection Act (NDP Act, 2023).
Who was Affected?
The party who lodged the complaint (a data subject whose information was used without consent)
was directly impacted.
More broadly, customers of Fidelity Bank could be affected, especially concerning how their
personal data is handled by bank tools, apps, and possibly third-party data processors.
How It Could Have Been Prevented
1. Ensure Informed Consent: Fidelity Bank should have made sure customers explicitly
consent before processing their personal data (especially for account opening online).
2. Strict Verification Procedures: Not allowing account creation to proceed until all required
documentation is submitted. Fidelity did claim they had policy for non-operational accounts with
missing documentation.
3. Full Compliance by Third-Party Processors
4. Better Cooperation and Transparency
